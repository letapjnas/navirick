  title: "Why Navirick?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    As the science of medical care improves, our healthcare system will have patients who live longer and treated earlier.  Our health navigators will inevitably have more patients under their careteam.  This equates to more encounters and cases.  To ease the caseload and streamline the communication, we need technology to rapidly shift the focus on managing data to treating and improving the patients' lives. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    An area that we are focused on is the treatment of cancer patients.  As earlier screening and treatment improves, patients will spend more time under the continuum of managed care.  We have seen a need for the advancement of technology to helpe cancer center navigators manage the flow of information between the care team, and directly with patients and the community.
